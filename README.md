### ***`kNN Case Study: Predicting Obesity Levels`***
*This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook detailing a case study on predicting obesity levels using the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm. The analysis leverages the Obesity Dataset, which includes individual eating habits, physical conditions, and demographic data as features.*

*The notebook provides a hands-on walk-through of a complete machine learning pipeline. It begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA), where feature distributions, skewness, and inter-feature relationships are examined using histograms and correlation heatmaps.*

**Core concepts of the kNN algorithm are explored through practical implementation, including:**

***01: A from-scratch kNN prediction function to demonstrate core mechanics.***

***02: The importance of data preprocessing with StandardScaler and LabelEncoder.***

***03: A performance comparison of different distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan, Cosine).***

*Finally, the notebook focuses on hyperparameter optimization. It visually demonstrates the bias-variance trade-off by plotting model accuracy against various k-values and employs 5-fold cross-validation to robustly determine the optimal k. The analysis concludes with an evaluation of the optimized model's performance on a test set.*

***Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.***
